Making a dashboard for the weather, where you can input data and retrieve the weather for the next 5 days.

## Description

This app helps the user check the weather for their selected city. It's clean and user friendly UI is easy to navigate and clearly displays the weather with icons. This also saves the searches in the local storage and this history is reflected underneath the search bar. This is so the user can navigate back to their recent searches without having to type in the location again. This is limited to 8 saved searches that show on the webpage. I built this to be a dynamic app that can help any travelling user easily check the weather in the city of thier choice. This makes travelling easier and is more convenient for the user because it reflects back the data inputted in a quick, concise manner. I also built this to challenge myself and what I have learnt so far during this bootcamp, I had to learn how to do multiple fetches and how to use geocode. I further had to find out how to convert the degrees that the API had into the measurement that is local to my country. This further helps users because if they are from a place that calculate their wether in celcius, they won't need to further look up what the temperature is in the city they are in. They can accurately gage the temperature in the measurement they are used to because I have already installed that conversion. This was a really challenging project, however, is something I am glad I achieved in the end, after fixing multiple bugs, I got this code to display the way I needed it to.

## Installation

At the top of this webpage there is a deployed URL that will open up the app, if you are on GitHub you can still find this link in the README section. Once deployed onto it's own page, simply type in the city you wish to view (by default it is set to London). This will show you the weather for the next 5 days and your recent search history will show underneath. If you are using VSCode, simply open up the HTML and run the page to be sent to the app.

## Usage

This is to be used to see the waether in whichever city you choose in real time. The icons also reflect the weather over a 5 day period. This is so the user can properly prepare themselves for any weather conditions 5 days ahead.
